# This American Scraper

_This American Lifeâ€™s_ archive is available to listen to for free on their
website. Unfortunately, the website does not provide an RSS feed for archived
episodes. This is strange, since the most obvious place people would want to
listen to a podcast archive would be through a podcast app.

This script scrapes the public TAL website and generates an RSS feed for use
with podcatchers. [Subscribe to the feed in this repository][4] or enter this
